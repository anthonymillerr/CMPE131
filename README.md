This Project is a web server client that serves as an "Online-Only" Bank, utiling HTML, CSS, PHP, and mySQL.
This web server allows registration and login through mySQL database tables, and functions within the bank allow
the user to "deposit" checks into any of their various checking or savings accounts, transfer funds
between their own accounts, or even other user's accounts. The deposits must first be approved by an Admin/Staff User,
through which then their account balance is to be updated. It will change from a 'Pending' status to an Approved, or Denied
depending on the decision of the staff. There is also a function to create a checking or savings account, and also a choice 
to delete them, through the verification that there are not any remaining funds within the account. The final function a user 
can utilize is viewing their transaction history that gives real-life time stamps of when the transaction was executed. 
This transaction function records deposits, transfers, and withdrawals. On the Admin/Staff side, the admin is able to view all 
account information, transactions, and has the ability to approve or deny deposit transactions.
